When no pressure is applied, the middle pin floats, use some sort of weak pullup, such as 100K ohm.",Active,B11-R7-C4,Input: Touch,10,12,10,3/26/23,2,5/16/23,6,,120%,,$12.95,Adafruit,Spectra Symbol,,,1069,https://www.adafruit.com/products/1069,https://www.amazon.com/SPECTRA-SYMBOLROTARY-SOFTPOT-46MM-CONNECTOR/dp/B00P6MVJKC,,,,,3:6/21/17,4:8/31/17,0:12/11/17,4:12/20/17,5:3/6/18,6:5/24/18,8:8/13/18,4:1/8/2019,6:02/13/19,4:04/10/19,4:5/20/19,3:6/18/21,5:7/29/21,1:12/20/21,6:1/25/22,6:5/25/22,,11:6/6/22,10:3/26/23,10:5/16/23,,,4:8/31/17,2:1/18/18,2:01/17/19,2:7/12/21,10:7/29/21,5:1/25/22,5:5/25/22,10:6/6/22,2:5/16/23,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pin 8 (top row, center pin) is the common cathode (common ground). The segments of the digit can be driven at approx. 20V from a bench supply. The comma and decimal point should only be driven at about 5V, as they will burn out at higher voltage.
